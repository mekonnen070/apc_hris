## **Amhara Police HRIS: Project Documentation**

Welcome\! This document will help you get started with the **Amhara Police HRIS** project. Its purpose is to serve as a comprehensive Human Resources Information System for the Amhara Police. This guide provides a complete overview of setting up your environment and understanding the project's architecture and features.

-----

### **ðŸš€ Getting Started**

This section will guide you through getting the project running on your local machine.

  * **Prerequisites**

      * Before you begin, you need to have a complete **Flutter development environment** set up. If you haven't done this yet, please follow the official guide from the Flutter team.
      * **Setup Guide**: [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

  * **Installation and Setup**

      * Follow these steps to clone the repository and prepare the project for development.

    <!-- end list -->

    1.  **Clone the repository**:
        ```bash
        git clone <repository-url>
        cd apc_hris
        ```
    2.  **Clean and Install Dependencies**: This command cleans the project directory and then runs `flutter pub get`. The `pub get` command will fetch all the necessary dependencies and also automatically handle the localization setup.
        ```bash
        flutter clean && flutter pub get
        ```
    3.  **Run Build Runner**: This command generates the necessary data classes and serialization logic using `freezed`. It's a crucial step for our state management and model classes.
        ```bash
        flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
        ```

  * **Localization Notes**

      * `flutter pub get` should automatically generate the necessary localization files.
      * If you ever find that localization strings are not updating correctly after making changes, you can manually run the following command as a backup to force regeneration:
        ```bash
        flutter gen-l10n
        ```

  * **Running the Application**

      * To run the app on a connected emulator or a physical device, use the following command:
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```

  * `main.dart`: The entry point of the application. This file initializes the app and sets up dependency injection.
  * `app.dart`: This is the root widget of the application (`MyApp`). It configures the theme, router, and localization delegates.
  * `splash_screen.dart`: The initial screen displayed to the user while the app is loading and checking authentication status.
  * `l10n/`: Contains the localization files (`.arb` files) for supporting English and Amharic languages.
  * `core/`: This directory contains the foundational logic and shared components of the application.
      * **API**: Handles all network requests and communication with the backend.
      * **Constants**: Defines application-wide constants.
      * **DI (Dependency Injection)**: Manages dependency injection setup for the core module.
      * **Errors**: Defines custom exception and failure classes for error handling.
      * **Providers**: Contains global Riverpod providers that are used across multiple features.
      * **Routes**: Manages application routing and navigation using `go_router`.
      * **Services**: Contains business logic services (e.g., file picker, dialogs).
      * **Theme**: Defines the application's visual theme, including colors and text styles.
      * **Widgets**: Contains reusable custom widgets (e.g., buttons, text fields) used across the app.
  * `features/`: This directory contains all the feature-specific modules of the application (e.g., authentication, profile, leave). Each feature is self-contained and typically follows a Clean Architecture pattern with its own `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` layers.
  * `providers/`: This directory is dedicated to Riverpod providers that manage the application's state, organized by feature.

### **State Management**

The application uses **Flutter Riverpod** for state management. This approach allows for a reactive and scalable way to manage state across the application. We also use the **Freezed** package to generate immutable data classes and unions, which helps prevent state-related bugs and ensures a predictable state flow.

-----

### **API Integration**

Communication with the backend API is handled using the **Dio** package, a powerful and reliable HTTP client for Dart. All API endpoints are centrally defined in the `ApiEndpoints` class located in the `core/constants/` directory. This makes it easy to manage and update API routes.
